## About the Project

You know how there are YouTube videos for workouts? Well, I was working out to some of those videos, and I would keep track of my workouts with a YouTube playlist. But I didn't like how I couldn't keep track of what days I worked out, and what videos I worked out to. That's what inspired me to create a workout tracker web application.

**Key Features:**
* Create, read, update, and delete workouts and fitness goals
* Store unlimited amount of YouTube videos associated with a workout
* Workouts and goals saved to browser local storage, saving application data so users can pick up where they left off

**A major challenge I overcame:** I was unsure of how to add an unlimited/undefined amount of YouTube videos for workouts. After researching, I implemented this feature by adding a new `FormControl` to my workout videos' `FormArray` each time the user clicks the button to add a new YouTube video. This makes it so the video form data changes dynamically when user adds/removes YouTube videos. I then transformed the YouTube video URLs from the user into YouTube embed URLs and displayed them on the webpage. However, I still had a big problem&mdash;my method of transforming these URLs into embed URLs did not check for possible cross-site scripting attacks. To fix this, I used a regular expression which described the format of a YouTube video. If the video URLs do not match this format, I display an alert to the user and do not add the workout data to the app.
